In this list-todo project I have used technologies like React js,Node js,Express js,MongoDB .
coming to the project the user interface consists of one input field and one button named "ADD" .
basically this list-todo is use to remember are add daily tasks need to be finish .
when ever the user enter something in the input field and press ADD button it automatically store the data whatever the user entered and displayed below the input field .
if any one of the user entered work is completed.we can strick up by pressing the entered task of the user .
we can also delete a particular task after the complication of the task .
whatever the data entered by the user is defaultly stored in the MongoDB .
it will update changes in the user interface .
for example : if there is no data in the dataBase .it shows "NO TODOS HERE ...."
